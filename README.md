# Notes-to-Self-for-Python
A collection of files containing both code and my own notes to help myself understand them.

Here's a collection of different practice problems and solutions that I've both found online, or worked upon myself.
Within the code, sometimes I have lengthy comments helping myself to understand what is actually occurring.
Both analyzing the code solutions and typing out these notes help me to better understand not only the code itself, but also the language and the practice of coding, in general.

Since I'm still learning, I've decided to put my notes that I found most helpful here as a way of having one centralized location to view them, in an effort to curb further frustration from staring at the code and not understanding the WHY of how it works.

I also find it enjoyable to try to decipher the code, and rewarding when I feel like I have a greater understanding afterwards.
